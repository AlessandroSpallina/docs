# Hypothetical Document Embedding Prompt

Hypothetical Document Embedding (HyDE)[^1] is a technique used to improve accuracy during similarity search among documents.

Similarity search is the task of comparing text [*embeddings*](../llm.md#embedding-model), i.e. the vector representation of documents,
to find similarities between them, e.g. during document question-answering.

As such, HyDE technique consists in asking the [language model](../llm.md#completion-model) to generate a hypothetical answer that is used as query for the similarity search task.
The idea behind this approach is that, during a question-answering task, using the hypothetical answer to search for similar documents would lead to better results than using the question itself as a search query.

Specifically, the Cat uses this method to retrieve the relevant memories that are provided as context and end up in the [Main Prompt](main_prompt.md).  
Moreover, it exploits a technique named few shots learning[^2].  
Namely, a method that consists in providing the [language model](../llm.md#completion-model) a few examples in the prompt to get more accurate answers.

By default, the HyDE prompt is the following:

```python
hyde_prompt = """You will be given a sentence.
If the sentence is a question, convert it to a plausible answer. 
If the sentence does not contain a question, 
just repeat the sentence as is without adding anything to it.

Examples:
- what furniture there is in my room? --> In my room there is a bed, 
a wardrobe and a desk with my computer
- where did you go today --> today I was at school
- I like ice cream --> I like ice cream
- how old is Jack --> Jack is 20 years old

Sentence:
- {input} --> """
```
