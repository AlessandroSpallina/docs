# Vector Memory Collections

The Vector Memory Collections are the lowest-level components of the [Long Term Memory](long_term_memory.md).  
These are particular databases that store the content in the form of geometrical vectors.

A vector memory comes in the guise of a named collection of vectors and additional, optional metadata.  
The latter can be used to filter the search in the database.  
Each vector represents a memory. They are also called *embeddings* as they are the results of the text-to-vector conversion yielded by the [embedder](../llm.md#embedding-model).

Such databases are particularly useful because they allow to fetch relevant documents based on the vector similarity
between a query and the stored embeddings.

By default, Vector Memory Collections are created when the Cat is installed or after a complete memory swap.

Nodes with the :hook: point the execution places where there is an available [hook](../plugins.md) to customize the execution pipeline.
