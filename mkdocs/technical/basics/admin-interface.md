# &#129526; The Admin Interface

The frontend interface of The Cheshire Cat can be accessed via `localhost:1865/admin`. This interface provides users with an easy-to-use chat that act as playground and can be used to interact with your application. The Cat core uses a static build of the admin, source code can be found [here](https://github.com/cheshire-cat-ai/admin-vue).

All the cat's settings are available under this GUI's `Settings` menu.
