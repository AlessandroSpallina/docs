# Play with the Cat

## Requirements

Ensure that the Cat is installed and running, and the LLM is configured.

## Chatting with the Cat: the Admin Portal playground

The Cat is an API-first framework, and it doesn't provide a ready-to-use UI for the end user.
It is your responsibility to implement this UI.
However, the Cat offers a playground that you can use to quickly test the AI you are implementing.

To access playground, go to the Admin Portal at `localhost:1865/admin`, and click on the `Home` tab.
This tab serves as the playground for chatting with the Cat. 

Try to ask something about socks, e.g. "what do you know about socks?".
The Cat will give a generic answer.
Afterward, we will expand this general knowledge with more specific information.

You have learned how to use the playground to test your AI via the Admin Portal.
